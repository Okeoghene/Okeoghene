**`Network Automation Engineer`**

I'm a passionate Network Automation Engineer with plenty of experience to share! This page showcases my skills and expertise, all of which come from an initiative I designed to develop my abilities. With five years in Network Engineering, I've honed my understanding of networking protocols like IGP, BGP, DHCP, DNS, and VLAN, just to name a few. Currently, I’m fortunate to work at Daisy in the Wavenet group as a Senior CPE-D Engineer. The ideas for these projects are all my own, and I’d love to connect! Feel free to drop me an email at [gmail] or reach out on [Linkedin].
