**`Network Automation Engineer`**

I'm excited to share my journey and insights as a dedicated Network Automation Engineer! This page showcases my skills and expertise, which I have developed through various initiatives to enhance my abilities. With five years of experience in Network Engineering, I have gained a profound understanding of networking protocols, including IGP, BGP, DHCP, DNS, and VLAN, among others! In addition to keeping up with the latest technologies, I have also boosted my skills in scripting (Python and Bash) and network automation with tools such as YANG, RESTCONF, NETCONF, and Ansible. I am proud to be a Senior CPE-D Engineer in Daisy's Wavenet group. Each project idea here is inspired by my work to design and practice beyond my day-to-day activities; I am researching and learning as I complete each task! Feel free to email me at [gmail] or on [Linkedin].
